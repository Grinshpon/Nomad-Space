Practice 3d software rendering project based on Javidx9's [3d engine series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih20l3pJoeU), using the [PixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine)

I'm planning on extending the project, and am currently reading about shadow mapping, and eventually would like to make a 3d game from scratch with this framework.

Can compile with `make build` and run with `make run` or by building and running the executable.

Note, I was, at the same time, lightly experimenting with C++20, but this should be currently compilable under C++17
